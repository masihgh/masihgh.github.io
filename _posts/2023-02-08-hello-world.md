# Hello World!

> Welcome to my blog! Iâ€™m Masih, and this is my very first post using the Chirpy theme for Jekyll. Iâ€™m super excited to share my journey with you as I dive into the world of static site generators and leave behind the clunky, slow, and frustrating world of WordPress. ðŸŽ‰

## Why Jekyll?
After spending way too much time dealing with WordPress plugins, updates, and security headaches, I decided to switch to Jekyll. And let me tell youâ€”itâ€™s so cool! Jekyll is fast, lightweight, and gives me full control over my site. Plus, writing posts in Markdown feels like a breath of fresh air compared to WordPressâ€™s bloated editor.

## What to Expect
This blog will be my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, projects, and everything Iâ€™m learning about web development, programming, and tech in general. Iâ€™m still figuring things out, so bear with me as I experiment and improve this site over time.

## Why Chirpy?
I chose the Chirpy theme because itâ€™s clean, modern, and packed with features. Itâ€™s perfect for someone like me who wants a professional-looking blog without spending hours tweaking CSS. Plus, itâ€™s open-source, so I can customize it to my heartâ€™s content.

## Goodbye, WordPress!
I wonâ€™t lieâ€”WordPress has its place, but itâ€™s just not for me anymore. Jekyll feels like the future: no databases, just simple, static files. And with GitHub Pages, hosting is free and super easy. Whatâ€™s not to love?
